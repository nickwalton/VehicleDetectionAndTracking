Here I use traditional computer vision techniques to extract features from an image, train a classifer and detect vehicles in a video stream using a sliding window approach. The code for this project is contained in the IPython notebook VehicleTracking.ipynb.

### 1. Training Data

The data I used for this project was provided by Udacity and included images from the GTI and also images extracted from the KITTI data set. The data is loaded and pre processed in the first cell of the IPython notebook.

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

### 2. Feature Extraction

Although in the past I've used convolutional neural networks to classify images, to get a better understanding of traditional computer vision techniques in this project I used feature extraction techniques such as Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOG) spatial binning and color histograms. My feature extraction functions were all defined in the second cell of my IPython notebook.

The goal with feature extraction is to get meaningful features that can be used by the classifier (in my case a linear SVM) but not so many that it takes too long to train and run your image through the classifier. 

#### Histogram Oriented Gradients

Histogram Oriented Gradients is a method that essentially takes a cell of pixels, for example 8x8 and computes the direction of the gradient for each pixel within that cell. For that 8x8 cell a histogram is computed of all these gradients and the peak of the histogram is taken as the orientation direction for that cell.

I tried out several different combinations of parameters with my classifier to see what would get the best accuracy and eventually decided on the following parameters:
`orientations=12`
`pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` 
`cells_per_block=(2, 2)`

Here is an example using the green channel with these HOG parameters.

#### Spatial Binning and Color Conversion

Using every pixel in an image is probably more information than we need, but there is still value in having pixel intensity information used in our classifier. For my classifier I tried out several different color space conversions and spatial binning parameters. I eventually decided on using the Y channel in the YCrCb color space and resizing the image to a 16x16 image. This kept much of the information that we use to recognize the object while still minimizing the number of features it created. Here is an example of the original image and the resize image.

#### Color Histogram

One possible method of object detection we could potentially try is through a technique called template matching. Essentially you have an example image and you try and match that image in the picture pixel for pixel. This works if the image looks exactly like the template, but if there are small variations between the images this method fails. However, there is a simliar method that is more robust and can be useful for our classification purposes. Instead of trying to match each pixel like in template matching we can take a histogram of the color and use that to try and match similar objects in the picture. This has some potential downfalls, but it can be a useful feature to give the classiifer more information about the object. 

Here is an example of the output of a color histogram on a car image:

#### Feature Normalization

After all the selected features have been extracted from the image they are all concatenated into one feature vector. However, because they come from several different techniques their scale can be vastly different. Before they are fed into the classifier they need to be normalized because without normalization it's possible for one feature to dominate the others. Here we can see the feature vector plotted before and after normalization.

### 3. SVM Linear Classifier

To classify whether or not a selected window contains a car or not I used a linear SVM classifier. A few other possibilities were tested, but a linear SVM was chosen for ease of training and also to help reduce the chance of overfitting possible with higher order dimension SVM's. 

I randomly split the data into 70% training data and 30% test data and was able to achieve about 99% accuracy on the test set giving me confidence that my classifier was working as expected. This is all implemented in the 4th cell of my IPython notebook.

### Vehicle Detection

#### Sliding Window
Now we have a classifier that can take images and decide whether they are cars or not. But there are often multiple cars in an image and we need to know not just if the image contains a car, but where and how many. To do that I implement a sliding window approach to find the location and number of cars. To do that I set up several sliding windows that search at different scales and different locations in the image. In general larger windows are used closer to the observing vehicle and smaller windows farther from the it. This section is implemented in cells five and six of my IPython notebook.

This was one of the most difficult sections for me. I had to spend a significant amount of time playing with the size, overlap and number of sliding windows to be able to get mostly reliable detection. 

Here is an example of just one of the sliding windows with a 50% overlap:

#### Classifying Sliding Window Images

Ultimately I searched on six scales using HOG on just the Y channel of a YCrCb color space image as well as a resized image and histograms of color to detect the vehicles in the sliding window. I usually got several detections and the image with bounding boxes would look like the following:

#### Merging Detections and Eliminating False Positives

To eliminate false positives and also to merge the overlapping detections of the same object I create a heat map with all the detected objects bounding box. This is done in cell seven of the notebook. This creates blobs that have "hotter" cells where more bounding boxes overlap and "cooler" cells where less or none do. With the heat map we can set a threshold to elminate false detections (cooler areas) and use the centroid of the heat objects to determine where vehicles are:

### Pipeline Examples

Overall I feel that my pipeline did fairly well for using only computer vision techniques. However there still is a lot to be desired and I would want to refine it a lot more before I let any self driving car make decisions based on it.

### Video Implementation

Finally I ran my pipeline on a test video to detect the vehicles in it.

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

One of the weakest points in my project was the sliding window approach. Often a vehicle wasn't well detected or the bounding box was wobbly due to the placement of the sliding windows. The more I increased the number of sliding windows the greater the computation expanded so simply increasing the sliding windows wasn't a good approach. What I could have done however to reduce that would be to implement a HOG across the whole image and then only draw upon that already computed HOG for HOG features for each window. That could probably have been done for spatial binning as well.

The other thing I could have done is add more tracking algorithms so that the object is tracked across multiple frames. This could have helped the tracker from losing the car for some frames, reduced false detections further and also help the boxes stay more stable as the car moved across the scene.
